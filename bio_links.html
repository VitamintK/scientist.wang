    <h1>bio and links</h1>
    went to UC Irvine from 2014-2018. While there, I participated in competitive programming. In my final year, my team achieved 3rd place in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230607153737/http://socalcontest.org/history/2017/details-2017.shtml">southern california ICPC regional</a>, losing to only two USC teams.
    <!-- Unfortunately, while 2 teams are usually allowed to advance to world finals (in which case we would have advanced), in this year only 1 team did, and we were not invited to world finals. -->
